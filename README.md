Earth has been our home for centuries now. It has sheltered us with care. We have taken a lot from it, but we never bothered restoring it.
We polluted our home. We have done horrible things and it is time we take responsibility for our actions. It is time to save the Earth

The superhero I choose is black panther aka T’challa. The reason why I chose black panther is how the people of Wakanda were able to harness advanced technologies, they stuck with their own tradition. 
They believed in their ancestors and respected their ways.

Moreover, King T’challa is an honourable person who thinks for the welfare of the country and its people. He is an natural leader. 
What's so great about Panther is he's a superhero who sees himself as a politician, as a leader in his country. 

It just so happens that the country is a warrior-based nation where the leaders have to be warriors, as well, so sometimes he has to go fight. 
So he was my first choice and my favourite superhero. WAKANDA FOREVER.
